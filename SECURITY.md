- ✅ Secured error logging

### 5. **Session Security**
- ✅ Secure session configuration
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies
- ✅ Secure cookies in production
- ✅ SameSite protection
- ✅ Session timeout (24 hours)

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=ecommerce

# JWT Secret (Generate a strong secret for production)
JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret_here

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Security Settings
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
```

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### 1. **Production Deployment**
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Use strong, unique secrets for JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Use environment-specific email credentials
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Use secure database credentials
- [ ] Regular security audits

### 2. **Database Security**
- [ ] Use strong database passwords
- [ ] Limit database user permissions
- [ ] Enable database encryption
- [ ] Regular database backups
- [ ] Monitor database access logs

### 3. **Email Security**
- [ ] Use app-specific passwords for Gmail
- [ ] Consider using a dedicated email service
- [ ] Monitor email sending limits
- [ ] Implement email rate limiting

### 4. **Code Security**
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security scanning with tools like `npm audit`
- [ ] Code review for security issues
- [ ] Remove debug code before production

## 🔍 Security Checklist

### Before Production:
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Strong passwords and secrets
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Error logging secured
- [ ] Session security configured

### Regular Maintenance:
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Rotate secrets quarterly
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Backup data regularly

## 🆘 Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Change all passwords immediately
   - Rotate JWT secrets
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review recent code changes
   - Check database access logs
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Scan for vulnerabilities

3. **Recovery:**
   - Update all credentials
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Implement additional security measures

## 📞 Security Contact
